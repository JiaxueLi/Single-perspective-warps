# Single-Perspective Warps in Natural Image Stitching

This repository is our implementation of the IEEE TIP 2019 paper, Single-perspective Warps in Natural Image Stitching. If you use any code or data from our work, please cite our paper.

### Usage

1. Download code, add images in the folder "Imgs" in the main path and run the "main.m".

2. This code has been tested on 64bit Windows; for other platforms, you'll need to compile your own mex files in folder "LSD_matlab" and "texture_mapping";
